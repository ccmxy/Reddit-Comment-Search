# website

Front end based on [WikipediaSearchEngine by Adarsh Khubchandani](https://codepen.io/askhubchandani/full/rLKRoo/)

On the opening page type in one, two, or three boxes to search by criteria of user, subreddit, and/or search word/phrase.     

On the page with one search box search with any combination of: user=<username>:: search=<search phrase>:: subreddit=<subreddit>::    

If a search phrase is specified but user and subreddit or not, comments are pulled from r/redditdev.
